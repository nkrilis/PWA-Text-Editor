  ## Description
  
  This project is a Progressive Web App that allows users to write code with syntax highlighting. The main functionallity of this application however is the ability to download the application to work natively on their desktop. This is done through `webpack` and a plugin called 'webpack-pwa-manifest` which allows the application to be bundled and installed. The application also has the ability to work offline, so that the user experience remains the same with or without an internet connection, this is done through cache storage. You can view the deployed application below
